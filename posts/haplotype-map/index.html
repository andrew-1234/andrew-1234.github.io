    <div class="content__body">
        <p>This is how I made a haplotype map using QGIS. There are different ways to do
this. This way is a bit hacky, but I liked the result compared to the
alternatives I tried in QGIS and other software. The result is a haplotype map
with individuals coloured by clade, and clustered. This lets you represent
clusters using pie charts, where the size is relative to the total number of
individuals at that cluster, and the colours of the pie correspond to your
different clades:</p>
<p><img src="map_ex.png" alt="final map"></p>
<p>I started with a points layer in QGIS, with labels for the clade:</p>
<p><img src="step1.png" alt="step1"></p>
<p>Then I clustered points based on distance using the “DBSCAN clustering” tool in
QGIS.  I used a 0.1 decimal degree buffer size.</p>
<p>This worked out to be around 40 km or so. I used some visual trial and error to
get the clusters that I thought were reasonable. The amount of clustering you do
will depend on your scale and research question. Although this clustering is
purely for a qualitative visual aid. The result is a layer that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="step2.png" alt="step2"></p>
<p>Now each point has a cluster ID representing the cluster it belongs to, and how
many points exist in total in that cluster ID. Some points may not be clustered
if they are too far from others (cluster_id  = NULL), and in my case that was
fine because they were isolated individuals and I didn’t want them pulled into a
cluster.</p>
<p>The problem is it is still 173 rows (all my samples) as individual points. So
the hacky part, I exported to <code>.csv</code> and changed the table format to wide and
made it look like this – 1 row per cluster (ID), and imported back into QGIS:</p>
<p><img src="step3.png" alt="step3"></p>
<p>And note – this table won’t include any leftover points which didn’t get
assigned a cluster, but I add those back in later with a separate layer after
making the pie charts.</p>
<p>To get the lat / lon of each cluster I calculated the mean lat and mean lon for
all points in that cluster.</p>
<p>So now I have 13 points, 1 for each cluster, with the frequencies of each
sample/haplotype in the clusters.</p>
<p>Then you go to layer properties for that layer, and diagrams, and select pie
chart, and I assigned the attributes as my clade columns.</p>
<p><img src="step4.png" alt="step4"></p>
<p>You can change the size to be scaled relative to the total and mess around with
the maximum value and minimum etc to make it look good. I think I scaled to
grand total but maximum value 72 because that was my biggest cluster. I can&rsquo;t
remember exactly how this works but its easy to change these values and see what
looks good or not.</p>
<p><img src="step5.png" alt="step5"></p>
<p>Eventually you will also want to output a nice figure, with the legend how you
want it, which is also in those settings.</p>
<p><img src="step6.png" alt="step6"></p>
<p>The final step is adding back in an extra layer of the leftover points which
didn’t cluster (if you have any).</p>
